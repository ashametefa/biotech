      <h1>ANCIENT BIOTECHNOLOGY</h1>
<p1>Biotechnology involves using living organisms in the production of food and medicine.
It dates back several thousand years to when people inadvertently discovered the usefulness
of one-celled organisms like yeasts and bacteria. The ancient Egyptians, for example, used 
yeast to brew beer and to make bread. Some 7000 years ago in Mesopotamia people used 
bacteria to convert wine into vinegar. And ancient civilizations exploited tiny organisms
that live in the earth by rotating crops in the field to increase crop yields. Theophrastus 
– an ancient Greek who lived 2300 years ago- swore that broad beans left magic in the soil. 
It took another 2200 years before a French chemist suggested that some soil organisms might be
able to fix atmospheric nitrogen fertilizer. Unexpected applications, although baking bread, 
brewing beer and making cheese have gone on for centuries, the scientific study of the
biochemical process is less than 200 years old. Clues to understanding fermentation emerged 
in the 17th century when Dutch experimentalist Anton van Leeuwenhoek examined scrapings from 
his teeth under a microscope and discovered microbes. Two centuries later the Frenchman
Louis Pasteur untangled some of the complex processes that yeast used in fermenting beer.
By the 1940s, genetics had transformed the US into leader of monoculture agriculture which
relied on a narrow range of genetic material and considerable high-tech. 
The Green Revolution arrived in the 1960s. Agriculture became obsessed with output.
Use artificial fertilizers increased. Seedless varieties became popular especially fruit
and vegetables and so did hybrids which reduced the viability of crops over generations,
forcing farmers to buy fresh seed every year. The world’s gene pool has been shrinking
rapidly ever since and many varieties have vanished forever. Power and resources became
concentrated among fewer farmers became dependent on the suppliers of seeds and inputs
to provide them with crop varieties and fertilizers. Cut off from knowledge and thus
control over the raw materials of farming, the farmers became less autonomous, and 
their capacity to conduct adaptive experiments diminished. If new varieties failed 
they had to wait for solutions from research stations. Alongside the dissolution of
expertize among farmers especially in the Third World the global seed industry
flourished. Some traditional medicine in biotechnology process also used organisms
or parts of organisms. For instance, by about 600 BC, the ancient Chinese were using
mouldy soybean curds to treat boils. Similarly, Ukrainian peasants were using
mouldy cheese to treat infected wounds. The moulds released natural antibiotics 
that killed bacteria and prevented the spread of infection. Despite these natural
treatments, it wasn’t until 1928 that Alexander Fleming first extracted penicillin
the first antibiotic from mould.  </p1>
