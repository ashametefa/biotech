  <h1>INTRODUCTION TO BIOTECHNOLOGY</h1>
  <p> I designed this website as an exercise on my programming course 
    assignment and for the sake of studying and knowing some simple concepts about biotechnology.
     This site will organise my experience of the course all different pages
      of the site containing all of my exercise.</p>
<P1>Biotechnology is a multidisciplinary field which has major impact on our lives.
The term biotechnology is coined by a Hungarian engineer Karl Erkey, in 1919 to 
refer the science and methods that permit products to be produced from raw materials
with the aid of living organisms. Biotechnology is a diverse field which involves either
working with living cells or using molecules derived from them for applications oriented 
toward human welfare using varied types of tools and technologies. It is an amalgamation 
of biological science with engineering whereby living organisms or cells or parts are used
for production of products and services. The biotechnology came into being ago when 
plants and animals began to be selectively bred and microorganisms were used to make beer, 
wine, cheese and bread. However, the field gradually evolved, and presently it is the use 
or manipulation of living organisms to produce beneficiary substances which may have medical,
agricultural and industrial utilization. The utilization of living systems or the
influencing or natural process so as to produce products, systems or environment to help
human development. Currently biotechnology places more emphasis on the establishment of 
hybrid genes followed by their transfer into organisms in which some, or all, of the gene
is not usually present. In prehistoric times, a primitive form of biotechnology was
practiced by agriculturists who established better quality species of plants and animals
by methods of cross-pollination or cross-breeding. Previous forms of biotechnology
include the training and selective breeding of animals, the cultivation of crops.
Later, it was discovered that the micro-organisms, e.g. bacteria, yeast or molds,
hydrolyze sugars when they lack oxygen and are ultimately responsible for 
fermentation. This process results in the formation of products (food and drink). 
Fermentation was first described by Louis Pasteur in the late 1800s. Structure 
for examining fermentation and other microbial developments were identified by Robert
Koch, Pasteur and Joseph Lister. The foundation of biotechnology was laid down after
the discovery of DNA in the early 1950s. The heredity material is deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) which contains all the information that dictates each and every step of 
an individualâ€™s life and then History of biotechnology as it will be discussed in the
next section.</P1>
